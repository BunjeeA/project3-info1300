# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **please do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Existing Project (Milestone 1)

**Tell us about the project you'll be using for Project 3.**

### Project (Milestone 1)
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project 1


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

My intended audience is people who want to get to know who I am that aren't opportuned to know me in real life; even for those who do know me to see more sides of me from what I make to what I have done in my life. This audience will mostly be people my age and perhaps older because those are the people I engage with most in life at this moment.


### Audience's Goals (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Simply list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc.
> You may adjust the goals if necessary.

1. Look at what projects I've created

2. Understand my goals/interests in life

3. See what I have accomplished(awards/programs)


## Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Image Carousel for projects
    I think that this would be helpful because the images will provide a full scope of the project/website even though they haven't opened it. It condensed the space used by the images before and allows the user to move at their own pace.

- Click Header to display contents
    On the projects page I have a lot of listed projects and I think having all the information listed at once can be a sore sight for the user. By clicking the header, you will only see the content you wish to look at.

- Use modal for contact page
    While I can list all of my contact information, I would also like to get in touch with the people that view my site and perhaps ask what brought them to view it.


### Interactivity Design Ideation (Milestone 1)
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch several iterations of your interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)

![Display Content](/design-plan/displayContent.JPG)

![Carousel](/design-plan/carousel.JPG)


### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)
> Create _polished_ sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

![Modal](/design-plan/modal.JPG)

![Display Content](/design-plan/displayContent.JPG)

![Carousel](/design-plan/carousel.JPG)


### Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (3-5 sentences)

These interactive elements are here to condense material while also making it more appealing. A jumble of words on a page makes a user disinterested in the content. My goal is to keep the user interested for as long as possible. Having the carousel allows less space to be taken up for images. The modal is also just an additional feature to make it look more professional.


## Interactivity Implementation Plan (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Planning Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Produce planning sketches that include all the details another 1300 student would need to implement your interactivity design.

![Display Content](/design-plan/displayContent.JPG)

![Carousel](/design-plan/carousel.JPG)


### Interactivity Pseudocode Plan (Milestone 1)
> Write your interactivity pseudocode plan here.
> Pseudocode is not JavaScript. Please do not put JavaScript code here.

![Pseudocode](/design-plan/pseudocode.JPG)



### "Ambitious" Interactivity Explanation (Milestone 1)
> In your own words, concisely explain why you believe your interactivity meets the "ambitious" requirement.
> This should be a few sentences. (1-3 sentences)

I believe this meets the ambitious requirement because it combines some concepts we've gone over/talked about in class but it also needs a little external additions. The modal will probably be the hardest interactive component to do because it also has to "cover" the content currently on the page when the button is clicked.


## Grading (Final Submission)

### Interactivity Usability Justification (Final Submission)
> Explain how your design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a large paragraph (4-6 sentences)

Affordances:
    In some elements, I wrote code so the cursor was a pointer when it hovers over a clickable element.

Visibility:
    After a clickable element is clicked, there is always a visible response. Some examples are: clicking the contact button which brings up the modal screen, clicking the nav bar buttons adds an active class to it and also changes the content/page being seen by the user.

Feedback:
    On hover of the home screen navbar and images, they expand in size showing that is is an interactive element.

Familiarity:
    The carousels shows familiarity because they have an left and right arrows as buttons that signify the direction of the changing images.


### Tell Us What to Grade (Final Submission)
> We aren't re-grading your Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed, we won't grade it.

General:
    - Hover over nav buttons
    - While on any page, click the contact nav button

Home Page:
    - Click each underlined name in the title

Projects Page:
    - Some of the projects used carousels to display their images. Click the left and right arrows to navigate through the images




### Collaborators (Final Submission)
> List any persons you collaborated with on this project.

N/A


### Reference Resources (Final Submission)
> Please cite any external resources you referenced in the creation of your project.
> (i.e. W3Schools, StackOverflow, Mozilla, etc.)

- W3Schools


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

I learned that there are many ways around a problem. It takes a certain amount of diligence and patience for web development to be fulfilling.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

Though I came into this class with previous knowledge and experience, I've come to appreciate the design aspect of website development. It's one thing to draw arbitrary wirefraes to build your sites but to actually explain and ideate with motivation is another skill. While it seemed tedious at times, planning everything out with a purpose from the start helped me create more advanced and usefule websites.
