# Project 3, Milestone 1 (p3m1) Feedback

This milestone is graded for a **completion grade _by task (section)_**. If you tried to complete the task, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that task**. If a task is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. There is no partial credit within a specific task. The checkbox items below are only for feedback; the checkboxes have no relation to your completion grade. **(An unchecked box does not mean you were deducted points for that item.)**

All files must be in the location specified in the assignment's requirements for credit; our grading process cannot reliably locate your work in other locations.

For _some_ assignments, we provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. **Our feedback is designed to help you learn more;** our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you receive, you are responsible for meeting all the project's requirements in your final submission.


**Student's NetID:** aoa26


## Existing Project

- [x] Student clearly identifies which project (1 or 2) they are using for Project 3 (see design journey.)
- [x] The website for Project 1 or 2 (HTML files, CSS files, and images) are copied into the root of the Project 3 repository.
- [x] No other files were copied from the Project 1 or 2 repository (e.g. Project 1 or Project 2 design journey.)
- [x] The `.vscode` folder only contains configuration files (i.e. `extensions.json`, `README.md`, and `settings.json`)
- [x] Project 3 design journey is named "design-plan/design-journey.md".

**Existing Project: 3 / 3 points** _(no partial credit)_

## Interactivity Design & Plan

- [ ] Proposal clearly communicates the site's interactivity, where it will go, and its purpose.
- [ ] Proposed interactivity rationale addresses the goals of the site's audience; interactivity's purpose is not to "wow" or impress.
- [x] Proposed interactivity is consistent with the audience's goals and likely enhances the user's experience accomplishing these goals.

- [x] Interactivity is _well_ integrated into the existing site; interactivity is not "tacked-on."
- [x] Final _design_ interactivity sketches (what the interactivity looks like on the website) clearly communicate how the interactivity will function.
- [x] Interactivity **planning** sketches (with planning annotations) include sufficient detail that another 1300 student could implement the interactivity.
- [x] Pseudocode plan is sufficiently detailed that another 1300 could implement the interactivity. (Pseudocode is not actual code.)

> **What needs improvement?**
> - Should be more clear and specific about what your site's proposed interactivity is and how each one will enhance your site for your audience

**Interactivity Design & Plan: 7 / 7 points** _(no partial credit)_

## Interactivity Scope

**Grader Instructions:** Do not guess here. If you are unsure, ask the instructor. This section is not for credit; this is feedback only.

- [x] Interactivity is sufficiently ambitious to demonstrate the student's understanding of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.
- [ ] Interactivity is _NOT_ too large or complex for this assignment. (More than 1 "ambitious" interactivity implementation is unnecessary for full credit on this assignment.)
- [x] Interactivity is likely feasible to implement with the skills learned this semester.
- [x] No prohibited interactivity (web forms, etc.)

> **What needs improvement?**
> - I really like your interactivity ideas! I just wanted to give you a heads up that implementing a carousel by itself would be enough for an ambitious interactivity- although the addition of a modal is nice, it is not necessary if you are already doing a carousel.


## Overall

- [x] Student has made good progress on their project.
- [x] Student does not have outstanding issues that will limit our ability to grade their final submission.
    (i.e. **files in _incorrect_ locations**, _missing_ files, _non-visible images_ in markdown preview, absolute resource URLs, etc.)

> **What did the student do well?**
> Nice job with your planning!

> **Do you have any additional feedback for the student?**
> N/A


**Total: 10 / 10 points** _(total of tasks)_
